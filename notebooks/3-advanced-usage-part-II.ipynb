    "* The name of the validation method can be any valid Python name, but it helps to be descriptive\n",

    "* The same method may be used to validate multiple fields by passing the name of each field as multiple arguments to the decorator\n",
    "* Validation methods can perform additional parsing of fields on top of any parsing automatically provided by Pydantic\n",

    "We successfully logged in! But notice the magic that happened here. Our database of users is just a list of dictionaries. None of the users in our database have `username` or `password1` attributes, yet `validate_credentials` was able to access these attributes without raising an exception. Evidently the `validate_arguments` decorator coerced the list of dictionaries into a list of `User` instances. Presumably, if we then alter our database to include invalid users, then we should get a validation error when we try to call `validate_credentials`. Let's see if we are right..."

As with any validation, this does take time so the drawback is a decrease in performance. Though, in practice, this drop in speed is almost never important."
