This can be done using the `create_model` function. The function takes the name of the model as the first argument, followed by the fields of the model. The fields are defined as a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the types of the fields. The types can be either Python types or Pydantic models. The function returns a Pydantic model class."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
