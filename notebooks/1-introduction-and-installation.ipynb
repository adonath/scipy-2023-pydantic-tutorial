    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial design choices of Python is the use of dynamic types. Dynamic types of variables can often lead to confusion for beginners, but also for experts it is a common sources of hard-to-find bugs. For this reason the concept of type annotations has been introduced later in the language to allow for static code analysis and more detailed source code documentation. However, type annotations are not enforced by the Python interpreter and therefore do not prevent the user from passing the wrong type of data to a function or class. This can lead to delayed code failure, bad user experiences, and difficult-to-find bugs."
